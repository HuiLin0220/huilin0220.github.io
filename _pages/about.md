I am a Ph.D. candidate at the iVPL lab at Northwestern University, supervised by <a href = 'https://sites.northwestern.edu/ivpl/'> Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos</a>. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision-based detection, segmentation, and generation in the areas of manufacturing and medical imaging. My first two years were spent studying automatic defect detection and thermal prediction during additive manufacturing; then, I worked on organ segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation in MRI, CT, OCT, X-ray, etc. 

Previously, I obtained a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019, supervised by <a href = 'http://english.mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1081/2036.htm'> Prof. Bin Li </a> and <a href = 'https://xwcv.github.io/'> Prof. Xinggang Wang</a>. I received a Bachelor's degree in Materials Processing and Control Engineering from Qiming College, HUST, in 2016.
