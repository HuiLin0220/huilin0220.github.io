#Senior Research Scientist at OPPO

Ph.D. at the iVPL lab at Northwestern University, supervised by <a href = 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aucB85kAAAAJ'> Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos</a> and <a href = 'https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=34612'> Prof. Daniel Kim</a>. My research focuses on deep learning and <font color=BLUE> computer vision </font>-based classification, detection, segmentation, and generation in manufacturing and medical imaging. 

My first two years were spent studying automatic defect detection and thermal prediction during additive manufacturing; then, I worked on segmentation and <font color=BLUE> unsupervised domain adaptation</font> in MRI, CT, OCT, X-ray, etc. I am proficient in RNN, GRU, GNN, GAN, Transformer, etc.

Previously, I obtained a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019, supervised by <a href = 'http://english.mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1081/2036.htm'> Prof. Bin Li </a> and <a href = 'https://xwcv.github.io/'> Prof. Xinggang Wang</a>. I received a Bachelor's degree in Materials Processing and Control Engineering from Qiming College, HUST, in 2016.
